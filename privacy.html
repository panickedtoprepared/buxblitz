                <h3>13. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p>While BuxBlitz strives to protect your personal information and provide a safe, enjoyable experience, we do not assume liability for any damages, losses, or claims arising from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of your information due to factors beyond our reasonable control, such as third-party breaches, hacking, or user error.</li>

                    <li>Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages related to your use of BuxBlitz, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This limitation of liability does not apply to damages resulting from our willful misconduct, fraud, or failure to comply with applicable privacy laws (e.g., COPPA, GDPR). Your use of BuxBlitz indicates your agreement to these terms, subject to the rights and protections outlined in this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
